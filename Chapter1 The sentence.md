#Chapter1: The sentence

##Sentence word order
###1.1  Inflected and uninflected languages
Many modern European languages are inflected. Inflected languages usually have the
following characteristics:

1. **Nouns have endings** which change depending on whether they are, for example, the
subject of a verb.
2. **There are complex agreements** between articles, adjectives and nouns to emphasise
the fact that a noun is, for example, subject or object, masculine or feminine, singular or
plural. The more inflected a language is (for example, German or Greek), the more complex
its system of endings (“inflexions”).
3. **Verbs "conjugate"**, so that it is immediately obvious from the endings which
‘person’ (first, second, third) is referred to and whether the ‘person’ is singular or plural.  

English was an inflected language up to the Middle Ages, but the modern language retains
very few inflexions. Some survive, like the genitive case ‘lady’s handbag’ where ‘lady’ requires ‘’s’
to show singular possession, or like the third person in the simple present tense (I work ~ He/
She/It works) where the ‘-s’ ending identifies the third person, or in the comparative and
superlative forms of many adjectives (nice, nicer, nicest).  

There are only six words in the English language which have different subject and object
forms (I/me, he/him, she/her, we/us, they/them and who/whom).  

This lack of inflexions in English tempts some people to observe (quite wrongly) that the
language has ‘hardly any grammar’. It would be more accurate to say that English no longer has
a grammar like that of Latin or German, but it has certainly evolved a grammar of its own, as
this book testifies.

In inflected languages we do not depend on the word order to understand which noun is the
subject of a sentence and which is the object, the endings tell us immediately. In English, the
order of words is essential to the meaning of a sentence. We have to distinguish carefully
between the subject-group and the verb-group (or predicate). The predicate is what is said
about the subject, it is all the words in a sentence except the subject:
subject group verb group (predicate)
The dog bit the man
The man bit the dog
2
English Grammar
As these examples show, a change in word order brings with it a fundamental change in
meaning, which would not be the case if the nouns had endings. This means that English is far
less flexible in its words order than many inflected languages.
1.2 The sentence: definitions of key terms
No discussion of the sentence is possible without an understanding of the terms: finite
verb, phrase, clause and sentence.
A finite verb must normally have:
• a subject (which may be ‘hidden’)
He makes. / They arrived. / We know.
• a tense
He has finished. / She will write. / They succeeded.
So, for example, ‘he writes’ / ‘she wrote’ and ‘he has written’ are finite, but ‘written’, by itself, is
not.
‘Made’ is finite if used in the past tense and if it has a subject (He made this for me), but it is
not if it is used as a past participle without an auxiliary.
The infinitive or the present and the past participles can never be finite.
Modal verbs [>Chapter 11] are also finite, even though they do not have tense forms like
other verbs (he must (wait), he may (arrive)), as are imperatives (Stand up!).
A phrase is a group of words which can be part of a sentence. A phrase may take the form
of:
• a noun phrase
a tube of toothpaste
• a prepositional (or adverbial) phrase
over the bridge
• a verb phrase, single verb-form or a combination of verbs
built (in stone) / will tell, have done.
• a question-word + infinitive
what to do / when to go
A clause is a group of words consisting of ‘a subject + finite verb (+ complement or object if
necessary)’
A sentence which contains one clause is called a simple sentence.
Stephen apologised at once.[>1.7]
3
English Grammar
Or it may contain more than one clause, in which case it is either a compound sentence or
a complex sentence.
Stephen realised his mistake and (he) apologised at once.
When he realised his mistake, Stephen apologised at once.
A sentence can take any one of four forms:
- a statement
- a question
- a command
- an exclamation
A sentence is a complete unit of meaning. When we speak, our sentences may be extremely
involved or even unfinished, yet we can still convey our meaning through intonation, gesture,
facial expression, etc. When we write, these devices are not available, so sentences have to be
carefully structured and punctuated. A written sentence must begin with a capital letter and
end with a full stop(.), a question mark(?) or an exclamation mark(!).
One-word or abbreviated utterances can also be complete units of meaning, particularly in
speech or written dialogue:
All right! / Good! / Want any help?
However, these are not real sentences because they do not contain a finite verb.
1.3 Basic word order in an English sentence
Although variations are possible[>1.6], the basic word order in a sentence that is not a
question or a command is usually:
subject group+ verb group (predicate)
subject + verb + object + adverbials
manner place time
I bought a hat at that shop yesterday.
The children ran home.
The taxi driver shouted at me angrily.
We ate our meal in silence.
The car stopped suddenly.
A young girl with long black hair walked confidently across the room.
1.4 Word order: definitions of key terms
A subject is normally a noun, pronoun or noun phrase, it usually goes before the verb. The
verb must ‘agree’ with the subject, so the subject dictates the form of the verb.
4
English Grammar
This ‘agreement’ between subject and verb is often called concord(􀔆􁧲􀓞􁛘). An object is
normally a noun, pronoun or noun phrase, it usually goes after the verb in the active(􀔆􀛖􁧍
􀮾). It can become the subject of a verb in the passive [>12.1-2].
A sentence does not always require an object. It can just be:
- subject + verb
- subject + verb + adverb
Some verbs do not take an object[1.9-10].
1.5 Making the parts of a sentence longer
We can lengthen a subject or object by adding a clause or a phrase:
- lengthening the subject
The man ran away.
The man who stole the money ran away.
- lengthening the object
I bought a raincoat.
I bought a raincoat with a warm lining.
*1.6 Some common variations on the basic word order
We normally avoid separating a subject from its verb and a verb from its object, though
there are exceptions even to this basic rule. However, note these common variations in the
basic ‘subject/verb/(object)/(adverbial)’ order:
• questions[>Chapter 13]:
Did you take your car in for a service?
When did you take your car in for a service?
• reporting verbs in direct speech[>15.3n4]:
‘You’ve eaten the lot!’ cried Frank.
• certain conditional sentences[>14.8, 14.18.3]:
Should you see him, please give him my regards.
• time references requiring special emphasis[>7.22, 7.24]:
Last night we went to the cinema.
• -ly adverbs of manner/indefinite time [>7.16.3, 7.24]:
The whole building suddenly began to shake.
Suddenly, the whole building began to shake.
• adverbs of indefinite frequency [>7.40]:
We often played dangerous games when we were children.
• adverb phrases [>7.19.2, 7.59.2]:
5
English Grammar
Inside the parcel (there) was a letter.
• adverb particles(back) and here/there [>7.59.1]:
Back came the answer — no!
Here/There is your coat.
Here/There it is.
• negative adverbs [>7.59.3]:
Never, in world history, has there been such a conflict.
• ‘fronting’: Items in a sentence can be put at the front for special emphasis
A fine mess you’ve made of this!

English Grammar
The Simple Sentence
1.7 The simple sentence
The smallest sentence-unit is the simple sentence. A simple sentence normally has one finite
verb. It has a subject and a predicate.
1.8 Five simple sentence patterns
There are five simple sentence patterns. Within each of the five groups there are different
sub-patterns. The five patterns differ from each other according to what (if anything) follows
the verb:
1. subject + verb
My head aches.
2. subject + verb + complement
Frank is clever / an architect.
3. subject + verb + direct object
My sister enjoyed the play.
4. subject + verb + indirect object + direct object
The firm gave Sam a watch.
5. subject + verb + object + complement
They made Sam redundant / chairman.
The examples listed above are reduced to a bare minimum. To this minimum, we can add
adjectives and adverbs:
His old firm gave Sam a beautiful gold watch on his retirement.
1.9 Sentence patterns: definitions of key terms
Any discussion of sentence patterns depends on a clear understanding of the terms: object
(direct or indirect),complement, transitive verb and intransitive verb.
A direct object refers to the person or thing affected by the action of the verb. It comes
immediately after a transitive verb.
Please don’t annoy me.
Veronica threw the ball over the wall.
An indirect object usually refers to the person who ‘benefits’ from the action expressed in
the verb, such as someone you give something to, or buy something for. It comes immediately
after a verb.
Throw me the ball.
Buy your father a present.
7
English Grammar
A complement follows the verb ‘be’ and verbs related to ‘be’, such as ‘seem’ [>10.23-26],
which cannot be followed by an object.
A complement completes the sense of an utterance by telling us something about the
subject.
For example, the words following is tell us something about Frank:
Frank is clever.
Frank is an architect.
A transitive verb is followed by an object.
A simple test is to put ‘Who(m)’ or ‘What’ before the question-form of the verb. If we get an
answer, the verb is transitive[>App 1].
Wh- question-form object
I met Jim this morning. Who(m) did you meet? Jim
I’m reading a book. What are you reading? A book
Most transitive verbs can be used in the passive. Some transitive verbs consist of more than
one part. such as ‘listen to’[>Apps 28-30, 32-33, 37].
An intransitive verb is not followed by an object and can never be used in the passive
[>App 1].
Some intransitive verbs consist of more than one part. such as ‘touch down’[>App 36]:
My head aches.
The plane touched down.
Some verbs, like ‘enjoy’, can only be used transitively and must always be followed by an
object; others, like ‘ache’, are always intransitive.
Verbs like ‘open’ can be used transitively or intransitively [>App 1.3].
• verb + subject (transitive) Someone opened the door.
• verb without object (intransitive) The door opened.
1.10 Pattern 1: subject + verb
My head + aches.
Verbs used in this pattern are either always intransitive, or verbs which can be transitive or
intransitive, here used intransitively.
1.10.1 Intransitive verbs [>App 1.2]
Examples: ache, appear, arrive, come, cough, disappear, fall, go.
Quick! The train’s arrived. It’s arrived early.
Some intransitive verbs are often followed by an adverb particle (come in / get up / run away
/ sit down, etc.) or adverbial phrase :
8
English Grammar
- verb + particle [>7.3.4]
He came in. / He sat down. / He stood up.
- verb + adverbial phrase [>7.3.3]
A crowd of people came into the room.
1.10.2 Verbs which are sometimes intransitive [>App 1.3]
Many verbs can be used transitively with an object (answering questions like What did you
do?) and intransitively without an object (answering the question What happened?).
Such as : break / burn / close / drop / fly / hurt / move / open / ring / shake / shut /
understand.
- with an object:
I rang the bell. / I rang it repeatedly.
- without an object:
The bell rang. / It rang repeatedly.
Other examples:
The fire burnt furiously.
Your essay reads well.
Sometimes the object is implied:
William smokes/eats/drinks too much.
1.11 Pattern 2: subject + verb + complement
Frank + is + clever / an architect.
The verb in this pattern is always ‘be’ or a verb related to ‘be’, such as: appear / become / look /
seem / sound / taste [>10.23-10.26].
1.11.1 Subject + ‘be’ + complement
The complement may be:
• an adjective Frank is clever.
• a noun Frank is an architect.
• an adjective + noun Frank is a clever architect.
• a pronoun It is mine.
• an adverb of place or time The meeting is here. The meeting is at 2.30.
• a prepositional phrase Alice is like her father.
1.12 Pattern 3 : subject + verb + direct object
My sister + answer + the phone.
Most verbs in the language can be used in this pattern. The direct object may take a variety
of forms, some of which are:
• a noun[>2.1] We parked the car in the car park.
9
English Grammar
• a pronoun[>4.1] We fetched her from the station.
• a reflexive pronoun[>4.24] We enjoyed ourselves at the party.
• an infinitive[>16.13] I want to go home now.
• an -ing form[>16.42] I enjoy sitting in the sun.
1.12.1 Verb + object + ‘to’ or ‘for’ + noun or pronoun[>1.9,1.13.2-1.13.3]
The following verbs can have a direct object followed by ‘to + noun or pronoun’, or (where the
sense permits) ‘for + noun or pronoun’. They do not take an indirect object:
admit / announce / confess / confide / declare / demonstrate / describe / entrust / explain /
introduce / mention / propose / prove / repeat / report / say / state / suggest.
Subject verb object (to + noun or pronoun)
Martin introduced his guests to Jane.
The noun or pronoun following to or for cannot be put after the verb, so we cannot say
‘explain me this’ as , for example, we can say ‘give me this’ where the indirect object can
immediately follow the verb [>1.13].
Gerald explained the situation to me. (Not *explained me*)
He explained it to me.(Not *explained me*)
Say it to me.(Not *Say me*)
I can’t describe this. Would you describe it for me, please?
The passive is formed as follows [compare>1.13.2]:
The guests were introduced to Jane.
The situation was explained to me.
‘To + noun or pronoun’ normally precedes a that-clause or an indirect question when the
object is very long:
Catherine explained to me what the situation was.
*1.13 Pattern 4: subject + verb + indirect object +direct object
They + gave + him + a watch.
1.13.1 General information about Pattern 4
Verbs like ‘bring’, ‘buy’ and ‘give’ can have two objects. The indirect object always follows the
verb and usually refers to a person.
The firm gave Sam a gold watch.
Sam is an indirect object. However, the direct object can come after the verb if we wish to
emphasise it. When this is the case, the indirect object is replaced by a prepositional phase
beginning with ‘to’ or ‘for’:
The firm gave a watch with a beautiful inscription on it to Sam.
The indirect object does not have to be a person:
I gave the car a wash.
If the direct object is a pronoun (very often ‘it’ or ‘them’), it normally comes immediately
after the verb. The indirect object is replaced by a prepositional phrase:
10
English Grammar
They gave it to Sam.
They gave it to him.
However, if both direct and indirect objects are pronouns, some verbs such as ‘bring’, ‘buy’,
‘fetch’, ‘give’, ‘hand’, ‘pass’, ‘send’, ‘show’, and ‘teach’ can be used as follows, particularly in
everyday speech:
Give me it. Show me it.
Give it me. Show it me.
‘Give me it’ is more common than ‘Give it me’. The pattern ‘give it me’ does not often
occur verbs other than ‘give’. The use of the object pronoun ‘them’(Give them me) is very
rare.
The verbs in Pattern 4 can fall into three categories:
1.13.2 Pattern 4 : Category 1: verbs that can be followed by ‘to’
He showed me the photo.
He showed the photo to me.
In the passive the subject can be the person to whom something is ‘given’ or the thing which
is ‘given’, depending on emphasis.
I was shown the photo.
The photo was shown to me.
Here is a selection of verbs that can be used in this way:
bring / give / grant / hand / leave (=bequeath) / lend / offer / owe / pass / pay / play /
post / promise / read / recommend / sell / send / serve / show / sing / take / teach / tell /
throw / write.
1.13.3 Pattern 4: Category 2: verbs that can be followed by ‘for’
He bought Jane a present.
He bought a present for Jane.
These sentences can be put into the passive in two ways:
Jane was bought a present.
A present was bought for Jane.
Here is a selection of verbs that can be used in this pattern. Normally only ‘bring’ and ‘buy’
can have a person as a subject in the passive.
bring / build / buy / call / catch / change / choose / cook / cut / do / fetch / find / fix / get /
keep / leave / make / order / prepare / reach / reserve / save / sing.
In Categories 1 and 2, ‘to’ or ‘for’ + noun or pronoun can be used when we wish to
emphasise the person who benefits from the action or when the indirect object is longer than
the direct object.
11
English Grammar
Barbara made a beautiful dress for her daughter.
He bought a gift for his niece who lives in Australia.
‘For’ can be ambiguous and its meaning depends on context. The emphasis can be on ‘the
recipient’:
Mother cooked a lovely meal for me. (=for my benefit)
or on the person acting on the recipient’s behalf:
I’ll cook the dinner for you(= on your behalf / instead of you)
‘For’ can be ambiguous when used after most of the verbs listed in 1.13.3; ‘for’ can refer
to the person acting on the recipient’s behalf when used after most of the verbs in 1.13.2.
1.13.4 Pattern 4: Category 3: verbs that can be used without ‘to’ or ‘for’
subject + verb + indirect object + direct object
I will tell you the truth soon.
subject + verb + indirect object only
I will tell you soon.
The passive can be formed in two ways:
You will be told the truth soon
The truth will be told to you soon.
The direct object may often be omitted but is implied after: ask / bet / forgive / grant /
owe / pay / promise / show / teach / tell / write.
I’ll write you.
I bet you.
I grant you.
I’ll promise you.
*1.14 Pattern 5: subject + verb + object + complement
They + appointed + him + chairman
疑问： Pattern 5 上面这个例句与 Pattern 4 的区别是什么？
Verbs used in this pattern are often in the passive. Here is a selection of common ones:
appoint / baptize / call / consider / christen / crown / declare / elect / label / make / name /
proclaim / pronounce / vote.
They appointed him chairman. He was appointed chairman.
They made Sam redundant. Sam was made redundant.
The complement is usually a noun, though after ‘call, consider, declare, make, pronounce’, it can
be an adjective or a noun:
12
English Grammar
They called him foolish / a fool.
Here are a few verbs that combine with an ‘object + adjectival complement’:
- drive (me) crazy/ mad/ wild
- get (it) clean/ dirty, dry/ wet, open/ shut
- find (it) difficult / easy
- hold (it) open / still
- keep (it) cool / fresh / shut
- leave (it) clean / dirty, open /shut
- like (it) hot
- make (it) easy / plain / safe
- open (it) wide
- paint (it) brown / red
- prefer (it) fried
- pull (it) shut / tight
- push (it) open
- want (it) raw
- wipe (it) clean / dry
Example: - Loud music drives me crazy.
- I’m driven crazy by loud music.
1.15 Joining two or more subjects
The subjects of two simple sentences can be joined to make one simple sentence with
conjunctions like : and, but, both…and, either…or, neither…nor, not only…but also.
Note the agreement between subject and verb in the following [compare> 5.31]:
- The boss is flying to Paris. His secretary is not flying to Paris.
- The boss and his secretary are flying to Paris.
- Both the boss and his secretary are flying to Paris.
- The boss is flying to Rome. His secretary is not flying to Rome.
- The boss but not his secretary is flying to Rome.
- The boss may be flying to Berlin. His secretary may be flying to Berlin.(One of the two may be flying there)
- Either the boss or his secretary is flying to Berlin.
- The boss isn’t flying to York. His secretary isn’t flying to York.
- Neither the boss nor his secretary is flying to York.
1.16 Joining two or more objects, complements or verbs
The objects of two simple sentences may be joined to make one simple sentence with
conjunctions such as: and, both…and…
I met both Jane and her husband.
I didn’t meet either Jane or her husband.
13
English Grammar
I met neither Jane nor her husband.
Adjective complements can be joined in the same way:
It was cold and wet.
It wasn’t cold or wet.
It was neither cold nor wet.
Two or more finite verbs can be joined to make a simple sentence.
We sang and danced all night.
14
English Grammar
The compound sentence
1.17 The compound sentence
We often need to join ideas. One way we can do this is to link simple sentences to form
compound sentences. This linking is achieved by any of the following:
- a semi-colon:
We fished all day; we didn’t catch a thing.
- a semi-colon, followed by a connecting adverb [>App 18]
We fished all day; however, we didn’t catch a thing.
- a co-ordinating conjunction (and, but, so, yet) often preceded by a comma:
We fished all day, but (we) didn’t catch a thing.
In a compound sentence, there is no single main clause with subordinate clauses depending
on it[>1.21]: all the clauses are of equal importance and can stand on their own, though of
course they follow a logical order as required by the context. We often refer to clauses in a
compound sentence as co-ordinate main clauses.
1.18 Word order and co-ordinating conjunctions
The word order of the simple sentence is generally retained in the compound sentence:
subject verb object conjunction subject verb complement
Jimmy fell off his bike, but (he) was unhurt.
The co-ordinating conjunctions which can be used to form compound sentences are:
and, and then, but, for, nor, or, so, yet, either…or…, neither…nor…, not only…but also…,(also/ as well /
too).
These can be used for the purposes of addition (and), contrast (but, yet), choice (or), reason
(for), continuation (and then) and consequence or result (so).
However, a single conjunction like ‘and’ can serve a variety of purposes to express:
- addition: We were talking and laughing. (= in addition to)
- result: He fell heavily and broke his arm. (= so)
- condition: Weed the garden and I’ll pay you £5. (= If…then)
- sequence: He finished lunch and went shopping. (= then)
- contrast: Tom’s 15 and still sucks his thumb (= despite this)
*1.19 Joining sentence patterns to make compound sentences
The five simple sentence patterns [>1.8] can be joined by means of co-ordinating
conjunctions.
• subject verb manner (P1) + (subject) verb complement (P2)
15
English Grammar
Frank worked hard and (he) became an architect.
• subject verb object (P3) + subject verb place (P1)
I have got a cold so I’m going to bed.
• subject verb object complement (P5) + (subject) verb object (P3)
They made him chairman but (they) didn’t increase his salary.
• subject verb complement (P2) + subject verb object object (P4)
Her birthday is next Monday so I must buy her a present.
1.20 The use of co-ordinating conjunctions(并列连词)
When the subject is the same in all parts of the sentence, it is usual not to repeat it.
We do not usually put a comma in front of ‘and’, but we generally use one in front of other
conjunctions:
1.20.1 Addition/sequence: and; both…and; not only…but…(too/as well); not only…but
(also)…; and then.
He washed the car and polished it.
He not only washed the car, but polished it (too/ as well).
He washed the car and then polished it.
When the subjects are different, they must both be used:
You can wait here and I’ll get the car.
Jim speaks Spanish, but his wife speaks French.
1.20.2 Contrast: but, yet
He washed the car, but didn’t polish it.
She sold her house, but/yet (she) can’t help regretting it.
1.20.3 Alternatives: either…or…; neither…nor…
He either speaks French, or understands it. (I’m not sure which)
He neither speaks French, nor understands it.
[My Note] The position of ‘either…or’ and ‘neither…nor’.
If verbs of both clauses are same, one of them will be omitted. In this case, ‘either’
can follow the verb.
If both clauses have different verbs, then you should put ‘either…or’ before each
verb.
Examples: He speaks either French or English.
He either speaks French, or understands it.
Now my question is: (He either speaks French or speaks English.)——(He either speaks
French or English.) —— Is this right or wrong?
1.20.4 Result: so
He couldn’t find his pen, so he wrote in pencil. (The subject usually repeated after ‘so’)
16
English Grammar
1.20.5 cause: for
We rarely stay in hotels, for we can’t afford it.
‘For’ gives the reason for something that has already been stated. Unlike ‘because’[>1.48], it
cannot begin a sentence. The subject must be repeated after ‘for’. This use of ‘for’ is more
usual in written language.
1.20.6 Linking simple sentences by commas, etc.
More than two simple sentences can be joined by commas with only one conjunction which
is used before the final clause. The use of a comma before ‘and’ is optional here.
I found a bucket, put it in the sink(,) and turned the tap on.
I took off my coat, searched all my pockets, but couldn’t find my key.
Sometimes subject and verb can be omitted. In such cases, a sentence is simple, not
compound.[> 1.15-16]
The hotel was cheap but clean.
Does the price include breakfast only, or dinner as well?
A second question can be avoided by the use of ‘or not’:
Does the price include breakfast, or not? (= or doesn’t it?)
17
English Grammar
The complex sentence: introduction
1.21 The complex sentence
Many sentences, especially in written language, are complex. They can be formed by linking
simple sentences together, but the elements in a complex sentence (unlike those of a
compound sentence) are not of equal importance. There is always one independent (or ‘main’)
clause and one or more dependent (or ‘subordinate’) elements. If removed from a sentence, a
main clause can often stand on its own.
Complex sentences can be formed in two ways:
1: by joining subordinate clauses to the main clause with conjunctions.
The alarm was raised (main clause) as soon as the fire was discovered (subordinate clause).
If you’re not good at figures (subordinate clause), it is pointless to apply for a job in a bank(main clause).
2: by using infinitive or participle constructions [> 1.57]. These are non-finite and are
phrases rather than clauses, but they form part of complex (not simple) sentences because they
can be re-expressed as clauses which are subordinate to the main clause.
To get into university you have to pass a number of examinations.(= If you want to get into university)
Seeing the door open, the stranger entered the house. (= When he saw the door open)
Many different constructions can be present in a complex sentence:
(a) Free trade agreements are always threatened (main clause)
(b) when individual countries protect their own markets (subordinate clause dependent on (a))
(c) by imposing duties on imported goods (participle construction dependent on (b))
(d) to encourage their own industries (infinitive construction dependent on (c))
The subject of the main clause must be replaced by a pronoun in a subordinate clause if a
reference is made to it.
The racing car went out of control before it hit the barrier.
A pronoun can occur in a subordinate clause before the subject is mentioned. This is not
possible with co-ordinate clauses(􀬚􀚜􀩜􀝙).
When she got on the train, Mrs Tomkins realised she had made a dreadful mistake.
Co-ordinate and subordinate clauses can combine in one sentence.
The racing car went out of control and hit the barrier several times before it came to a stop on a grassy bank.
The five simple sentence patterns [>1.8] can be combined in an endless variety of ways.
Subordinate clauses can be classified under three headings:
- noun clauses : He told me that the match had been cancelled.
- relative (or adjectival) clauses : Holiday resorts which are very crowded are not very pleasant.
- adverbial clauses : However hard I try, I can’t remember people’s names.
18
English Grammar
The complex sentence: noun clauses
1.22 How to identify a noun clause
Compare:
He told me about the cancellation of the match.
He told me that the match had been cancelled.
‘Cancellation’ is a noun, ‘that the match had been cancelled’ is a clause (it has a finite verb). The
clause is doing the same work as the noun, so it is called a noun clause.
Like any noun, a noun clause can be the subject or (far more usually) object of a verb, or the
complement of the verb ‘be’ or some of the verbs related to ‘be’, such as ‘seem’ and ‘appear’:
I know that the match will be cancelled. (object)
That the match will be cancelled is now certain. (subject of be)
1.23 Noun clauses derived from statements
Noun clauses derived from statements are usually that-clauses (sometimes what-clauses),
though the conjunction ‘that’ is often omitted. Look at the following statement:
Money doesn’t grow on trees.
By putting ‘that’ in front of a statement, we turn it into a subordinate noun clause which can
be joined to another clause. As such, it will do the same work as a noun and can be used as
follows:
1.23.1 Noun clauses as the subject of a verb
That money doesn’t grow on trees should be obvious.
We tend to avoid this construction, preferring to begin with ‘it’, followed by ‘be’, ‘seem’, etc.
It is obvious (that) money doesn’t grow on trees.
Such clauses are not objects, but are ‘in apposition’ to the ‘preparatory subject’ ‘it’ [> 4.13].
‘That’ cannot be omitted at the beginning of a sentence, but can be left out after many
adjectives [>App 44] and a few nouns such as: (it’s) a pity, a shame.
1.23.2 Noun clauses as the object of a verb
That is often omitted before a noun clause which is the object of a verb, especially in
informal style.
Everybody knows (that) money doesn’t grow on trees.
After many verbs (believe know think), the use of ‘that’ is optional. After some verbs (answer
imply), ‘that’ is generally required. ‘That’ is also usual after ‘reporting verbs’, such as ‘assure’ and
‘inform’, which require an indirect object [>App 45.2]. ‘That’ is usually obligatory in anger
sentences, especially when the that-clause is separated from the verb.
The dealer told me how much he was prepared to pay for my car and that I could have the money without
delay.
19
English Grammar
A that-clause cannot follow a preposition.
He boasted about his success. = He boasted that he was successful.
However, a preposition is not dropped before a noun clause that begins with a
question-word.[>1.24.2]
He boasted about how successful he was.
1.23.3 Noun clauses after ‘the fact that’, etc.
By using expressions like ‘the fact that’ and ‘the idea that’ we can avoid the awkwardness of
beginning a sentence with ‘that’.
The fact that his proposal makes sense should be recognised.
The idea that everyone should be required to vote by law is something I don’t agree with.H
These expressions can be used after verbs such as ‘to’, ‘face’:
We must face the fact that we might lose our deposit.
The fact that also follows prepositions and prepositional phrases [>App 20.3] like: because of, in
view of, on account of, owing to, due to, in spite of, despite and notwithstanding (formal).
His love of literature was due to the fact that his mother read poetry to him when he was a child.
In spite of / Despite the fact that hotel prices have risen sharply, the number of tourists is as great as
ever.
1.23.4 Noun clauses after adjectives describing feelings
Many adjectives describing personal feelings (afraid glad happy pleased sorry) or certainty (certain
sure) can be followed by ‘that’ (optional) [>App 44]
I’m afraid (that) we’ve sold out of tickets.
1.23.5 Transferred negatives after verbs of thinking and feeling
After verbs like ‘believe’ ‘imagine’ ‘suppose’ ‘think’, we can transfer the negative from the
verb to the that-clause without really changing the meaning [compare ‘contrasting negatives’
>16.14]. So, for example, these pairs of sentences have almost the same meaning.
I don’t believe she’ll arrive before 7.
I believe she won’t arrive before 7.
I don’t suppose you can help us.
I suppose you can’t help us.
1.24 Noun clause derived from questions
Noun clauses can be derived from Yes/No questions and question-word questions.
[>Chapter 13]
1.24.1 Noun clauses derived from Yes/No questions [>15.17-18]
Here is a direct Yes/No question:
Has he signed the contract?
By putting if or whether in front of it and by changing the word order to subject-predicate,
we turn it into a subordinate noun-clause that can be used:
20
English Grammar
- as a subject
Whether he has signed the contract (or not) doesn’t matter. (‘if’ is not possible)
- as a complement after be
The question is whether he has signed the contract. (‘if’ is not possible)
- as an object after verbs, especially in indirect questions [>15.18n5]
I want to know whether/if he has signed the contract (or not).
- as an object after a preposition
I’m concerned about whether he has sign the contract (or not). (if is not possible)
‘Whether’ is obligatory if the clause begins a sentence, it is obligatory after ‘be’ and
after prepositions.
Either ‘whether’ or ‘if’ can be used after a verb and after a few adjectives used in the
negative, such as ‘not sure’ and ‘not certain’ [>App 44].
If there is doubt about the choice between whether and if as subordinating conjunctions, it
is always safe to use whether.
Note: ‘or not’ can be used optionally, particularly with ‘whether’.
1.24.2 Noun clauses derived from question-word questions [>15.19-23]
Here is a direct question-word question:
How soon will we know the results?
Question-word questions (beginning with who(m) what which when where why and how, plus a
change in word order) can function as noun clauses and can be used:
- as a subject
- When he did it is a mystery.
- after be
- The question is when he did it.
- after reporting verbs
- I wonder when he did it.[> 16.24]
- after verb + preposition or adjective + preposition
- It depends on when he did it.
- I’m interested in when he did it.
We can use ‘what’(not ‘that’ ‘which’) instead of ‘the thing(s) that’ to introduce a noun clause.
What may be considered to be a relative pronoun [>1.27] here.
What matters most is good health. (the thing that matters)
Compare the use of ‘What’ as a question word (when it does not have the meaning ‘the
thing(s) that’) in direct and indirect questions.
What made him do it? I wonder what made him do it.

English Grammar
The complex sentence: relative pronouns
and relative clauses
1.25 How to identify a relative clause[关系从句]
Compare:
Crowded holiday resorts are not very pleasant.
Holiday resorts which are crowded are not very pleasant.
The word ‘crowded’ in the first sentence is an adjective, ‘which are crowded’ is a clause (it has a
finite verb ‘are’). The clause is doing exactly the same work as the adjective, it is describing the
holiday resorts (or qualifying the noun holiday resorts). So we can call it an adjectival clause or
(more usually) a relative clause because it relates to the noun, in this case by means of the word
‘which’. Relative clauses (like adjectives) can describe persons, things and events.
1.26 The use and omission of commas in relative clauses
There are two kinds of relative clauses in the written language:
1: Relative clauses without commas (sometimes called defining, restrictive or
identifying). They provide essential information about the subject or object.
What kind of government would be popular?
-The government which promises to cut taxes.
2: Relative clauses with commas (sometimes called non-defining, non-restrictive or
non-identifying). They provide additional information which can be omitted.
The government, which promises to cut taxes, will be popular.
The inclusion or omission of commas may seriously affect the meaning of a sentence.
Compare:
The government which promises to cut taxes will be popular.
The government, which promises to cut taxes, will be popular.
The first sentence refers to any government which may come to power in the future. The
second is making a statement about the popularity of the government that is actually in power
at the moment. Whatever it does, this government will be popular. Among other things, it
promises to cut taxes. Alternative punctuation, such as dashes, would further emphasise the
introduction of additional information:
The government - which promises to cut taxes - will be popular.
Or we could use brackets:
The government (which promises to cut taxes) will be popular.
In speech, a break in the intonation pattern indicates these markings. For example, when
reading aloud or delivering a news bulletin.
22
English Grammar
Not all relative clauses need be rigidly classified as defining or non-defining. The inclusion or
omission of commas may be at the writer’s discretion when it does not result in a significant
change in meaning.
He asked a lot of questions (,) which were none of his business (,) and generally managed to annoy everybody.
*1.27 Form of relative pronouns in relative clauses
Relative pronouns as subject:
People He is the man who (or that) lives next door.
Things This is the photo which (or that) shows my house.
Possession He is the man whose car was stolen.
Relative pronouns as object:
People He is the man (who/ whom/ that) I met.
People He is the man (-) I gave the money to.
Things This is the photo (which/that) I took.
Things This is the pan (-) I boiled the milk in.
Possession It was an agreement the details of which could not be altered.
1.28 Relative pronouns relating to people
Relative pronouns which can be used with reference to people are who, whom and that the
possessive whose.
Don’t confuse the relative pronoun that with the subordinating conjunction [>1.23]
1.29 Relative pronoun subject of relative clause: people
Who and that can be used in place of noun subjects or subject pronouns (I / you / he. etc)
[>4.3].
When they refer to the subject, they cannot normally be omitted. We never use a subject
pronoun and a relative pronoun together to refer to the subject. Not ‘He is the man who he lives next
door’.
Who and that remain unchanged whether they refer to masculine, feminine, singular or
plural:
- masculine He is the man who/that lives next door.
- feminine She is the woman who/that lives next door.
- plural masculine They are the men who/that live next door.
- plural feminine They are the women who/that live next door.
We can use that in place of who, but we generally prefer who when the reference is to a person
or persons as subject of the verb.
1.29.1 Typical defining relative clause with ‘who’ as subject
23
English Grammar
Who or that is possible in the relative clause:
A doctor examined the astronauts who/that returned from space today.
1.29.2 Typical non-defining relative clause with ‘who’ as subject
‘Who’ must be used in non-defining relative clauses, ‘that’ is not possible.
The astronauts, who are reported to be very cheerful, are expected to land on the moon shortly.
1.30 Relative pronouns relating to things and animals
Relative pronouns which can be used with reference to things and animals are which and
that.[but compare>4.8]
1.31 Relative pronoun subject of relative clause: things/animals
Which and that can be used in place of noun subjects that refer to things or animals, or in
place of the subject pronouns it or they. When which/that refer to the subject, they cannot
normally be omitted. We never use a subject pronoun and a relative pronoun together to refer
to the subject. Not *The cat which it caught the mouse*. Which and that remain unchanged
whether they refer to the singular or the plural:
- singular This is the photo which/that shows my house.
- plural This is the photos which/that show my house.
1.31.1 Typical defining relative clause with ‘which’ as subject
Which or that are possible in the defining relative clause:
The tiles which/that fell off the roof caused serious damage.
1.31.2 Typical non-defining relative clause with ‘which’ as subject
Which must be used in non-defining clauses, that is not possible:
The Thames, which is now clean enough to swim in, was polluted for over a hundred years.
1.32 ‘Whose’ as the subject of a relative clause: people/things
Whose can be used in place of possessive adjectives (􁇔􀔆􀕤􁦯 my, your, his, her, etc)
[>4.19]. It remains unchanged whether it refers to masculine, feminine, singular or plural:
- masculine He is the man whose car was stolen.
- feminine She is the woman whose car was stolen.
- plural masculine They are the men whose cars were stolen.
- plural feminine They are the women whose cars were stolen.
Whose can replace the possessive adjective ‘its’:
This is the house whose windows were broken.
However, this use of whose is often avoided by native speakers who regard ‘whose’ as the
genitive of the personal ‘who’. Instead of this sentence, a careful speaker might say:
24
English Grammar
This is the house where the windows were broken.
Where the context is formal, ‘of which’ should be used, not ‘whose’:
It was an agreement the details of which could not be altered.
Or…It was an agreement of which the details could not be altered.
1.32.1 Typical defining relative clause with ‘whose’ as subject
The millionaire whose son ran away from home a week ago has made a public appeal.
1.32.2 Typical non-defining relative clause with ‘whose’ as subject
Sally Smiles, whose cosmetics company has been in the news a great deal recently, has resigned
as director.
1.33 Relative pronoun object of relative clause: people
Who(m) and that can be used in place of noun objects that refer to people, or in place of
object pronouns(me, you, him, etc)[>4.3]
When they refer to an object they are usually omitted, but only in defining clauses.
When included, whom is commonly reduced to who in everyday speech. We never use an
object pronoun and a relative pronoun together to refer to the object. Not *He is the man (that)
I met him*. Who(m) and that remain unchanged whether they refer to masculine, feminine,
singular or plural:
- masculine He is the man who(m)/that I met on holiday. He is the man I met on holiday.
- feminine She is the woman who(m)/that I met on holiday. She is the woman I met on holiday.
- plural masculine They are the men [who(m)/that] I met on holiday.
- plural feminine They are the women [who(m)/that] I met on holiday.
1.33.1 Typical defining relative clause with ‘who(m)/that’ as object
When the reference is to a person or persons as the object of the verb, we often use ‘that’.
Alternatively, we omit the relative pronoun to avoid the choice between who and whom.
That energetic man (who(m)/that) we met on holiday works for the EEC.
1.33.2 Typical non-defining relative clause with ‘who(m)’ as object
Who(m) must be used in non-defining clauses, that is not possible:
The author of ‘Rebels’, who(m) I met at a party last week, proved to be a well known journalist.
1.34 Relative pronoun object of relative clause: things/animals
That and which, referring to things and animals, are interchangeable in the object position.
However, both are commonly omitted, but only in defining clauses. We never use an object
pronoun and a relative pronoun together to refer to the object: Not *This is the photo (which) I
took it.*
That and which remain unchanged whether they refer to singular or plural:
- singular: This is the photo that/which I took. This is the photo I took.
25
English Grammar
This is the cat that/which I photographed. This is the cat I photographed.
- plural: These are the photos that/which I took. These are the photos I took.
These are the cats that/which I photographed. These are the cats I photographed.
1.34.1 Typical defining relative clause with ‘that’ or ‘which’ as object
The shed has begun to rot: We built it in the garden last year.
The shed (that/which) we built in the garden last year has begun to rot.
1.34.2 Typical non-defining relative clause with ‘which’ as object
Which must be used in non-defining clauses; that is not possible.
The shed in our garden, which my father built many years ago, has lasted for a long time.
1.35 Relative pronoun object of a preposition: people
When we wish to refer to a person, only whom (not that) can be used directly after a
preposition. In this position, whom cannot be omitted and cannot be reduced to who or be
replaced by that. This use is formal and rare in everyday speech:
He is the man to whom I gave the money.
The preposition can be moved to the end-position. If this happens, it is usual in speech to
reduce whom to who; it is also possible to replace who(m) by that:
She is the woman whom/who/that I gave the money to.
However, the most usual practice in informal style, when the preposition is in the endposition,
is to drop the relative pronoun altogether, but only in defining clauses:
They are the people I gave the money to.
There’s hardly anybody he’s afraid of.
1.35.1 Typical defining relative clause with a preposition [􀬃􀕕􁦯􁌱􀙉􁔮􀕗􀝙]
That person is the manager. I complained to him.
The person to whom I complained is the manager.
The person who(m)/that I complained to is the manager.
The person I complained to is the manager.
1.35.2 Typical non-defining relative clause with a preposition
Who(m) must be used in non-defining clauses, that is not possible:
The hotel manager refunded part of our bill. I complained to him about the service.
The hotel manager, to whom I complained (OR who(m) I complained to ) about the service, refunded part of
our bill.
1.36 Relative pronoun object of a preposition: things/animals
When we wish to refer to things or animals, only which (not that) can be used directly after
a preposition. When used in this way, which cannot be omitted. This use is formal and rare in
speech:
26
English Grammar
This is the pan in which I boiled the milk.
The preposition can be moved to the end-position. if this happens, it is possible to replace
which by that:
This is the pan that (or which) I boiled the milk in.
However, the relative is usually dropped altogether when the preposition is in the endposition,
but only in defining clauses:
This is the pan I boiled the milk in.
These are the cats I gave the milk to.
1.36.1 Typical defining relative clause with a preposition
The agency is bankrupt. We bought our tickets from it.
The agency from which we bought our tickets is bankrupt.
The agency which/that we bought our tickets from is bankrupt.
The agency we bought our tickets from is bankrupt.
1.36.2 Typical non-defining relative clause with a preposition
Which must be used in non-defining clauses, that is not possible:
The Acme Travel Agency has opened four new branches. Our company has been dealing with it for several years.
The Acme Travel Agency, with which our company has been dealing for several years, has opened
four new branches.
The Acme Travel Agency, which our company has been dealing with for several years, has opened
four new branches.
*1.37 ‘Whose’ + noun with a preposition
‘Whose + noun’ can be used as the object of a preposition(􀕕􁦯􀨽􁧍). The preposition may
come before whose or at the end of the clause:
He is the man from whose house the pictures were stolen.
He is the man whose house the pictures were stolen from .
When ‘whose’ is used in a relative clause as a proposition object, word order of the
clause is different from a statement sentence.
whose在关系从句中代指宾语时，需要注意从句的词序，因为whose和从句的宾语会被提

*1.38 Relative clauses of time, place and reason
Defining and non-defining relative clause of time, place and reason are possible in which
‘when’ ‘where’ and ‘why’ are used in place of relative pronouns. (􁬯􀝙􁦾􀹜􁫝􀸎􀕋􀔍􀕗􀝙􀒘)
They can also replace words like ‘the time’, ‘the place’ and ‘the reason’. Though we can say the
time when, the place where and the reason why, we cannot say *the way how*[>1.47.1].
Note that ‘when’ follows only ‘time’ nouns, such as day, occasion, season; ‘where’ follows
only ‘place’ nouns, such as house, place, town, village; ‘why’ normally follows the noun ‘reason’.
1.38.1 Time
• defining:
1979 was the year (in which) my son was born.
1979 was (the year) when my son was born.
• non-defining:
The summer of 1969, the year (in which) men first set foot on the moon, will never be forgotten.
The summer of 1969, (the year) when men first set foot on the moon, will never be forgotten.
1.38.2 Place
• defining:
This is the place in which I grow up.
This is the place which I grow up in.
This is the place I grow up in.
This is the place where I grow up.
• non-defining:
The Tower of London, in which so many people lost their lives, is now a tourist attraction.
The Tower of London, (the place) where so many people lost their lives, is now a tourist attraction.
1.38.3 Reason
• defining:
That’s the reason (for which) he dislikes me.
28
English Grammar
That’s (the reason) why he dislikes me.
• non-defining:
My success in business, (the reason) for which he dislikes me, has been due to hard work.
My success in business, the reason why he dislikes me, has been due to hard work. (The reason cannot be
omitted before why.)
1.38.4 (‘That’) in place of ‘when’, ‘where’, ‘why’
That is possible (but optional) in place of when, where and why but only in defining clauses:
I still remember the summer (that) we had the big drought. ( (that) can be replaced by when or during
which)
I don’t know any place (that) you can get a better exchange rate. ((that) can be replaced by where or at
which)
That wasn’t the reason (that) he lied to you. ((that) can be replaced by why or for which)
For relatives after ‘it’ [>4.14].
1.39 Relative clauses abbreviated by ‘apposition’
We can place two noun phrases side-by-side, separating the phrases by commas, so that the
second adds information to the first. We can then say that the noun phrases are ‘in apposition’
[>3.30]. This is more common in journalism than in speech. A relative clause can sometimes be
replaced by a noun phrase in this way:
My neighbour Mr Watkins never misses the opportunity to tell me the latest news. (defining, without commas)
Mr Watkins, a neighbour of mine, never misses the opportunity to tell me the latest news. (non-defining, with
commas)
(= Mr Watkins, who is a neighbour of mine, …)
*1.40 ‘that’ after ‘all’,etc. and superlatives
That (Not *which*) is normally used after words like all, any, anything, everything, a few
and the only one, when they do not refer to people.
Clauses of this kind are always defining.
All that remains for me to do is to say goodbye.
Everything that can be done has been done.
I’ll do anything (that) I can.
Who is used after all, any and a few when they refer to people:
God bless this ship and all who sail in her. [>5.24]
That is also common after superlatives. It is optional when it refers to the object[>6.28.1]:
It’s the silliest argument (that) I’ve ever heard.
But not optional when it refers to the subject:
Bach’s the greatest composer that’s (or who’s) ever lived.
29
English Grammar
*1.41 ‘of’ + relative referring to number/ quantity
‘Of’ can be used before whom and which in non-defining clauses to refer to number or
quantity after numbers and words like the following:
a few, several, some, any, many, much (of which), the majority, most; all, none; either/
neither; the largest/the smallest; the oldest/the youngest; a number, half, a quarter.
Both players, neither of whom reached the final, played well.
The treasure, some of which has been recovered, has been sent to the British Museum.
*1.42 ‘which’ in place of a clause
Which can be used to refer to a whole clause, not just one word. In such cases, it can be
replaced by and this, and that:
She married Joe, which (= and this/that) surprised everyone.
Which, in the sense of this or that, can also be used in expressions such as in which case, at
which point, on which occasion, which can refer back to a complete clause:
I may have to work late, in which case I’ll telephone.
The speaker paused to examine his notes, at which point a loud crash was heard.
Which, in the sense of this or that, can replace a whole sentence; and in informal style, can
even begin a sentence:
He was fined £500. Which we all thought served him right.
*1.43 Reference in relative clauses
A relative clause follows the person or thing it refers to as closely as possible to avoid
ambiguity.
Compare:
I cut out the advertisement which you wanted in yesterday’s paper. (an unambiguous reference to the
advertisement)
I cut out the advertisement in yesterday’s paper which you wanted. (which could refer either to the
advertisement or the paper)
A sentence can contain more than one relative:
It’s the only building (which) I’ve ever seen which is made entirely of glass. (The first which would normally
be omitted)

English Grammar
The complex sentence: adverbial clauses
1.44 How to identify an adverbial clause
Compare:
I try hard, but I can never remember people’s names.
However hard I try I can never remember people’s names.
Hard is an adverb, however hard I try is an adverbial (or adverb) clause. It is telling us
something about (or modifying) can never remember.
Adverbs can often be identified by asking questions ‘When?’ ‘Where?’ ‘How?’ ‘Why?’ etc.
[>7.2] and adverbial clauses can be identified in the same way:
time Tell him as soon as he arrives. (when?)
place You can sit where you like. (where?)
manner He spoke as if he meant business. (How?)
reason He went to bed because he felt ill. (Why?)
1.45 Adverbial clauses of time
1.45.1 Conjunctions in adverbial clauses of time
These clauses broadly answer the question When? and can be introduced(􀭚􀩕) by the
following conjunctions:
When / after / as / as long as / as soon as / before / by the time (that) / directly / during the time
(that) / immediately / the moment (that) / now (that) / once / since / until / till / whenever / while.
We generally use a comma when the adverbial clause comes first.
You didn’t look very well when you got up this morning.
After she got married, Madeleine changed completely.
I pulled a muscle(拉伤肌⾁) as I was lifting a heavy suitcase.
You can keep these records as long as you like. [compare as long as in conditional sentences> 14.21]
Once you’ve seen on penguin, you’ve seen them all.
He hasn’t stopped complaining since he got back from his holidays.[compare since in clauses of
reason>1.48]
We always have to wait till/until the last customer has left.
1.45.2 Tenses in adverbial clauses of time: ‘no future after temporals’
When the time clause refers to the future, we normally use the simple present after ‘after’
‘as soon as’ ‘before’ ‘by the time’ ‘directly’ ‘immediately’ ‘the moment’ ‘till’ ‘until’ ‘when’
where we might expect a simple future, or we use the present perfect where we might expect
the future perfect.
These two tenses are often interchangeable after temporal conjunctions:
The Owens will move to a new flat when their baby is born (or has been born).
The present perfect is often used after ‘once’ and ‘now that’ :
31
English Grammar
Once (=when) we have decorated the house we can move in.
Now that we have decorated the house (action completed) we can move in.
1.45.3 ‘Will’ after ‘when’
Though we do not normally use the future in time clauses, will can be used after when in
noun clauses [>1.24.2].
The hotel receptionist wants to know when we will be checking out tomorrow morning.
‘When’ meaning ‘and then’ can be followed by present or future:
I shall be on holiday till the end of September when I return (or when I shall return) to London.
1.46 Adverbial clauses of place
These clauses answer the question ‘Where?’ and can be introduced by the conjunctions:
where, wherever, anywhere and everywhere.
Adverbial clauses of place normally come after the main clause:
You can’t camp where/wherever/anywhere you like these days.
Anywhere, everywhere and whenever (but not usually where) can begin a sentence,
depending on the emphasis we wish to make:
Everywhere Jenny goes she’s mistaken for Princess Diana.
Where generally refers to a definite but unspecified place [>1.38]:
The church was built where there had once been a Roman temple.
Wherever, anywhere and everywhere suggest ‘any place’:
With a special tram ticket you can travel wherever/anywhere/everywhere you like in Europe for just
over £100.
1.47 Adverbial clauses of manner
1.47.1 ‘as’ [>App 25.25] and ‘in the way’
These clauses answer the question How? and can be introduced by the conjunction ‘as’.
Adverbial clauses of manner normally come after the main clause:
Type this again as I showed you a moment ago. (in the way I showed you)
This fish isn’t cooked as I like it. (in the way I like it)
How and the way can be used colloquially in place of as:
This steak is cooked just how/the way I like it.
Clauses of manner can also express comparison when they are introduced by expressions
like: (in) the way, (in) the way that, the way in which, (in) the same way, (in) the same way as.
She’s behaving (in) the same way her elder sister used to.
1.47.2 ‘As if’ and ‘as though’ after ‘be’, ‘seem’, etc.
32
English Grammar
Adverbial clauses of manner can also be introduced by the conjunctions as if and as
though after the verbs : be, act, appear, behave, feel, look, seem, smell, sound, taste.
I feel as if / as though I’m floating on air.
Note also constructions with it:
It sounds as if/as though the situation will get worse.
It feels as if/as though it’s going to rain.(I feel that this is going to happen)
As if/as though can be used after any verbs describing behaviour:
Lillian was trembling as if /as though she had seen a ghost.
She acted as if she were mad.[>11.75.1n2]
1.48 Adverbial clauses of reason
1.48.1 Conjunctions in adverbial clauses of reason
These clauses broadly answer the question Why? and can be introduced by the following
conjunctions : because, as, seeing (that), since.
As/Because/Since there was very little support, the strike was not successful.
I’m afraid we don’t stock refills for pens like yours because there’s little demand for them.
1.48.2 The relative position of clauses of reason and main clauses
As a general rule, whatever we want to emphasise (reason or main clause) comes at the
end.
We often begin sentences with as or since because the reasons they refer to may be known to
the person spoken to and therefore do not need to be emphasised.
As/Since you can’t type the letter yourself, you’ll have to ask Susan to do it for you.
Because generally follows the main clause to emphasise a reason which is probably not
known to the person spoken to[see ‘for’>1.20.5].
Jim’s trying to find a place of his own because he wants to feel independent.
Because can always be used in place of as/since/for to give a reason or reasons, but these
conjunctions cannot always be used in place of because.
1.49 Adverbial clauses of condition
These clauses can be introduced by conjunctions such as: assuming (that), if, on condition
(that), provided (that), providing (that), so/as long as, unless.
*1.50 Adverbial clauses of concession
Adverbial clauses of concession introduce an element of contrast into a sentence and are
sometimes called contrast clauses. They are introduced by the following conjunctions:
although, considering (that), though, even though, even if,
much as(虽然很…), while, whereas(鉴于),
33
English Grammar
however much/badly/good etc.
no matter how, no matter how much, etc.
‘Even though’ is probably more usual than though/although in speech.
Although/Though/Even though I felt sorry for him, I was secretly pleased that he was having
difficulties.
We intend to go to India, even if air fares go up again between now and the summer.
Much as I’d like to help, there isn’t a lot I can do.
While I disapprove of what you say, I would defend to the death your right to say it.
‘However’ combines with numerous adjectives and adverbs:
However far it is, I intend to drive there tonight.
No matter can combine with question words (who, when, where, etc) to introduce clause of
concession.
No matter where you go, you can’t escape from yourself.
Compounds[􀥔􀝳􁦯] with ‘-ever’ can introduce clauses of concession in the same way as ‘No
matter’.
Whatever I say, I seem to say the wrong thing. (Whatever=No matter what)
We can use ‘may’ in formal style in place of the present after all conjunctions introducing
clauses of concession.
However brilliant you are/may be, you can’t know everything.
Whatever you think/may think, I’m going ahead with my plans.
‘As’ and ‘though’ to mean ‘regardless of the degree to which’ can be used after some
adjectives, adverbs and verbs to introduce clauses of concession in formal style.
Unlikely as it sounds/may sound, what I’m telling you is true. (=Though it sounds/may sound
unlikely…)
Beautiful though the necklace was, we thought it was over-priced so we didn’t buy it. (=Though the necklace
was beautiful…)
Try as he might, he couldn’t solve the problem. (=Though he tried he couldn’t…)
1.51 Adverbial clauses of purpose
1.51.1 Conjunctions in adverbial clauses of purpose
These clauses answer the questions What for? and For what purpose? and can be introduced
by the following conjunctions: so that / in order that / in case / lest / for fear (that).
So as to and in order to also convey the idea of purpose, but they are variations on the toinfinitive,
not conjunctions. They do not introduce a group of words containing a finite verb
[>1.21n2].
Constructions with to, so as to and in order to are much simpler than those with that and are
generally preferred [>16.12.1].
1.51.2 Sequence of verb forms in adverbial clauses of purpose
When the verb in the main clause is in the present, present perfect or future, ‘so that’ and ‘in
order that’ can be followed by: may, can, will.
34
English Grammar
So that is more common than in order that.
I’ve arrived early so that/in order that I may/can/will get a good view of the procession.
‘So that’ and ‘in order that’ may also be followed by the present:
Let us spend a few moments in silence so that/in order that we remember those who died to preserve our
freedom.
When the verb in the main clause is in the simple past, the past progressive, or the past
perfect, ‘so that’ and ‘in order that’ are followed by should, could, might or would:
I arrived early so that/in order that I should/could/might/would get a good view of the procession.
Note the negative after ‘so that’ and ‘in order that’:
I arrived early so that/in order that I might not miss anything. (should not and would not would be
possible, but not could not)
Infinitive constructions with: not to, so as not to, in order not to are more normal[>16.12.1]:
I arrived early so as not to miss anything.
They must have worn gloves in order not to leave any fingerprints.
1.51.3 ‘In case’, ‘lest’ and ‘for fear’
‘Should’, ‘might’ or the present must be used after ‘in case’ when there is a future reference:
We’ve installed an extinguisher next to the cooker in case there is ever(there should/might ever be)
a fire.
I’m taking a raincoat with me in case I need it.
‘Should’ is optional after (the relatively rare) ‘lest’:
We have a memorial service every year lest we (should) forget our debt to those who died in battle. (so
that/in order that we might not forget…)
The subjunctive[> 11.75.1n2] could also be used after ‘lest’:
I avoided mentioning the subject lest he be offended.
I asked them to ring first lest we were out.
‘For fear’ is usually followed by ‘might’, but the same idea can be expressed more easily with
‘in case + past’:
I bought the car at once for fear (that) he might change his mind.
I bought the car at once in case he changed his mind.
*1.52 Adverbial clauses of result
*1.52.1 Conjunctions and sequence of verb forms in clauses of result
These clauses describe consequences. They can be introduced by ‘that’ after ‘so+adjective’ to
answer questions such as: ‘How (quick)…?’.
His reactions are so quick (that) no one can match him.
and by ‘that’ after ‘so+adverb’ to answer questions such as: ‘How (quickly)…?’:
He reacts so quickly (that) no one can match him.
They can also be introduced by ‘that’ after ‘such (a) + noun (or adjective + noun)’ to answer
questions like: ‘What’s he like?’.
35
English Grammar
He is such a marvellous joker (that) you can’t help laughing.
They are such wonderful players (that) no one can beat them.
When ‘that’ is omitted informally, a comma is sometimes used:
His reactions are so quick(,) no one can match him.
‘Such + obligatory that’ can be used in formal English as follows:
His reactions are such that no one can match him.
Result clauses with and without ‘that’ can also be used after ‘so + much/many/few/little etc.’:
There was so much to lose (that) we couldn’t take any risks.
They can also be used after ‘such a lot of ’:
There was such a lot of rain (that) we couldn’t go out.
‘So’ and ‘such’ (heavily stressed in speech) can be used without ‘that’, so a that-clause may be
strongly implied:
He was so angry. (that there were consequences)
The children made such a mess! (that there were consequences)
In colloquial English, ‘that’ is sometimes heard in place of ‘so’:
It was that cold, (that) I could hardly get to sleep.
The roads were that icy! (that there were consequences)
1.52.2 Clauses of purpose compared with clauses of result
In a purpose clause we can always replace ‘so that’ by ‘in order that’, which we cannot do in a
result clause:
We arrived early so that/in order that we could/should/might/would get good seats. (we arrived
early for that purpose)
We arrived early so (that) we got good seats. (we got good seats as a result of arriving early)
Or: We arrived so early that we got good seats.
A further difference is that a result clause always follows the main clause, whereas a purpose
clause can precede the main clause :
So that I shouldn’t worry, he phoned me on arrival.
In the spoken language there are differences in intonation between so that (purpose) and so
that (result).
1.53 Adverbial clauses of comparison [compare>4.7.3, 6.27.1]
These clauses often answer ‘How?’ followed by or implying ‘in relation to’ or ‘compared
with’ (How quick is he in relation to/compared with…?).
They involve the use of :
as + adjective + as (as quick as),
as + adverb + as (as quickly as),
not so/as … as,
36
English Grammar
-er than,
more … than,
less … than,
the … the
When continuing with the same verb in the same tense, we can omit the second verb, so the
clause of comparison is implied:
He is as quick in answering as his sister (is).
He answers as quickly as his sister (does).
He is not so/as quick in answering as his sister (is).
His sister is quicker than he (is).
He moves more slowly than his sister (does).
The more you practise, the better you get.
There are instances when we can drop both subject and verb:
When I spoke to him on the phone this morning, he was more agreeable than (he was) last night.
Adverbial clauses of comparison can involve the use of ‘as (or so) much+noun+as’ and ‘as many
+noun+as’. Words like ‘half ’, ‘nearly’ and ‘nothing like’ will often combine with ‘as’ or ‘so’ :
He didn’t sell half as/so many videos as he thought he would.
Words like ‘just’, ‘twice’/‘ten times’ will combine only with ‘as’:
You’ve made just as (Not *so*) many mistakes as I have.
1.54 Limiting adverbial clauses
A main clause can be qualified or limited by clauses introduced by ‘in that’ ‘in so far as’ and
‘inasmuch as’
The demonstration was fairly peaceful in that/in so far as there were only one or two clashes with the
police.
‘Inasmuch as’ can be used like ‘in so far as’ but is formal and rare.
1.55 Abbreviated adverbial clauses
Most kinds of clauses can be abbreviated by deleting the subject and the verb ‘be’ after the
conjunction.
time While (she was) at college, Delia wrote a novel.
place Where (it is) necessary, improvements will be made.
manner He acted as if (he was) certain of success.
condition If (it is) possible, please let me know by this evening.
concession Though (he was) exhausted, he went to bed very late.
Clauses of reason cannot be abbreviated in this way. However, they can often be replaced by
participle constructions. Such constructions also have the effect of shortening clauses [>1.58].

English Grammar

passive being found having been found found
1.57 Joining sentences with participles
Simple sentences can be combined into one sentence that contains a main clause + a
participle or an infinitive construction[>1.58,16.12.1].
Participle constructions are generally more typical of formal style than of informal, though
they can easily occur in both.
• simple sentences He walked out of the room. He slammed the door behind him.
• compound sentence He walked out of the room and slammed the door behind him.
• participle construction He walked out of the room, slamming the door behind him.
• simple sentences You want to order a vehicle. You have to pay a deposit.
• complex sentence If you want to order a vehicle, you have to pay a deposit.
• infinitive construction To order a vehicle, you have to pay a deposit.
• participle construction When ordering a vehicle, you have to pay a deposit.
Participle constructions can come before or after the main clause, depending on the
emphasis we wish to make:
Making sure I had the right number, I phoned again.
Or: I phoned again, making sure I had the right number.
Does these two sentences have the same meaning or not?
More than one participle construction is possible in a sentence:
After looking up their number in the phone book and making sure I had got it right, I phoned again.
1.58 Present participles in place of clauses
1.58.1 Participle constructions in place of co-ordinate clauses
The co-ordinating conjunction ‘and’ must be dropped:
She lay awake all night and recalled the events of the day.
38
English Grammar
She lay awake all night, recalling the events of the day.
1.58.2 Present participle constructions in place of clauses of time
Present participles can be used after the time conjunctions: after / before / since / when /
while.
But they cannot be used after the conjunctions: as / as soon as / directly / until, etc.
Since I phoned you this morning, I have changed my plans.
Since phoning you this morning, I have changed my plans.
We cannot use this construction when ‘since = because’ [>1.48].
‘On’ and ‘in’ can be used to mean ‘when’ and ‘while’:
On finding the front door open, I became suspicious. (When / At the moment when I found…)
In/While trying to open the can, I cut my hand. (During the time when I was trying…)
1.58.3 Present participle constructions in place of clauses of reason
As I was anxious to please him, I bought him a nice present.
Being anxious to please him, I bought him a nice present.
1.58.4 Present participle constructions in place of conditionals
The present participle can be used after ‘if ’ and ‘unless’ :
If you are travelling north, you must change at Leeds.
If travelling north, you must change at Leeds.
Unless you pay by credit card, please pay in cash.
Unless paying by credit card, please pay in cash.
1.58.5 Present participles in place of clauses of concession
The present participle can be used after the conjunctions: although / even though / though /
while.
While he admitted that he had received the stolen jewellery, he denied having taken part in the robbery.
While admitting that he had received the stolen jewellery, he denied having taken part in the robbery.
1.58.6 Present participles constructions in place of relative clauses
The present participle can be used in place of defining [>1.26] clauses in the simple present
or present progressive after relative pronouns.
The train which is arriving at Platform 8 is the 17.50 from Crewe.
The train arriving at Platform 8 is the 17.50 from Crewe.
1.59 Prefect participle constructions
Prefect participle constructions can be used in place of clauses in the present perfect and
past perfect and the simple past.
39
English Grammar
The action described in the perfect participle construction has always taken place before the
action described in the main clause:
• active We have invited him here to speak, so we’d better go to his lecture.
Having invited him here to speak, we’d better go to his lecture.
• passive I have been made redundant, so I’m going abroad.
Having been made redundant, I’m going abroad.
1.60 Participle constructions with ‘being’ and ‘having been’
The present participle form of ‘be’ (being) can be used in place of the finite form is/are/was/
were, the perfect participle form (having been) can be used in place of the finite forms ‘have been’
and ‘had been’.
These participle constructions are rare in everyday speech and only likely to occur in formal
writing.
He is so ill he can’t go back to work yet.
Being so ill, he can’t go back to work yet.
He was so ill he couldn’t go back to work for a month.
Being so ill, he couldn’t go back to work for a month.
He has (or had) been ill for a very long time, so he needs/needed more time to recover before he can/
could go back to work.
Having been ill for a very long time, so he needs/needed more time to recover before he can/could go back
to work.
These forms occur in passive constructions[>12.2].
Participle constructions with ‘it’ and ‘there’ occur in formal style:
It being a bank holiday, all the shops were shut. (=As it was…)
There being no further business, I declare the meeting closed. (=As there is no further business, I declare
the meeting closed.)
Participle constructions are common after ‘with/without’ [>App 25.36]
• The crowds cheered. The royal party drove to the palace.
• With the crowds cheering, the royal party drove to the palace.
• They debated for hours. No decision was taken.
• They debated for hours without a decision being taken.
1.61 Avoiding ambiguity with present participle constructions
The participle must relate to the subject of both verbs:
Reading my newspaper, I heard the doorbell ring. (=I was reading my newspaper and I heard the
doorbell ring)
Now compare: *Reading my newspaper, the doorbell rang.*
This sentence suggests that the doorbell is the subject and it was reading my newspaper.
‘Reading’ is here called an ‘unrelated participle’ and the sentence is unacceptable. However,
this rule dose not apply to a number of fixed phrases using ‘unrelated participle’ such as:
40
English Grammar
broadly/generally/strictly speaking, considering, judging, supposing, taking everything into
account.
Strictly speaking, you ought to sign the visitors book before entering the club. (you are not strictly
speaking)
Judging from past performances, he is not likely to do very well in his exams. (he is not judging.)
When the participle construction follows the object, it must be related to the object and
then sentence is acceptable.
I found him lying on the floor. (=he was lying on the floor)
1.62 Past participle constructions in place of clauses
Past participle constructions are more likely to occur in formal and literary style than in
conversation.
1.62.1 Past participle constructions in place of the passive
The past participle can be used without any conjunction in front of it in place of the passive:
When it was viewed from a distance, the island of Nepenthe looked like a cloud.
Viewed from a distance, the island of Nepenthe looked like a cloud.
1.62.2 Past participle constructions in place of adverbial clauses
The past participle can also be used with a conjunction in front of it to replace a passive:
Although it was built before the war, the engine is still in perfect order.
Although built before the war, the engine is still in perfect order.
If you are accepted for this post, you will be informed by May 1st.
If accepted for this post, you will be informed by May 1st.
Unless it is changed, this law will make life difficult for farmers.
Unless changed, this law will make life difficult for farmers.
After / before / since / on / in cannot be followed directly by a past participle, they require:
‘being’ + past participle.
After/When we were informed the flight would be delayed, we made other arrangements.
After/On being informed the flight would be delayed, we made other arrangements.
1.62.3 Past participle constructions in place of relative clauses
Past participle constructions can be used in place of defining clauses[>1.26] deleting ‘which
+be’.
The system which is used in this school is very successful.
The system used in this school is very successful.
1.63 Avoiding ambiguity with past participle constructions
Same subject, therefore acceptable [compare>1.61]:
41
English Grammar
Seated in the presidential car, the President waved to the crowd.
Unrelated, therefore unacceptable:
*Seated in the presidential car, the crowd waved to the President.*
Past participle related to the object:
We preferred the house painted white. (Can’t say *Painted white, We preferred the house.*)

English Grammar
Chapter2: NOUN
One-word nouns
2.1 What a noun is and what it does
A noun tells us what someone or something is called. For example, a noun can be the name
of a person, a job title, the name of a thing, the name of a place, the name of a quality, or the
name of an action.
2.2 Noun endings
Some words function only as nouns, others function as nouns or verbs, while others
function as nouns or adjectives, we cannot identify such words as nouns from their endings or
suffixes.
However, many nouns which are related to verbs or adjectives have characteristic endings,
such as ‘er’ and ‘ity’.
There are no easy rules to tell us which endings to use to make nouns, but [>App 2] will give
you some help.
2.3 Noun/verb contrasts
Some words can be either nouns or verbs. We can often tell the difference from the way they
are stressed and pronounced.
2.3.1 Nouns and verbs distinguished by stress [>App 3.1]
When the stress is on the first syllable, the word is a noun, when the stress is on the second
syllable, it is a verb. [>App 3.1]
The meanings are generally related:
noun We have finished Book 1. We have made good ‘progress.
verb We are now ready to pro’gress to Book 2.
but can be different:
noun My son’s ‘conduct at school hasn’t been very good.
verb Mahler used to con’duct the Vienna Philharmonic.
2.3.2 Nouns distinguished by pronunciation
43
English Grammar
/s/,/z/,/f/,/v/,/θ/,/ð/
When the ending is pronounced with no voice, it is a noun; when it is pronounced ‘hard’, it is
a verb. Sometimes this difference is reflected in the spelling:
/s/ and /z/ abuse/abuse, advice/advise, house/house, use/use
/f/ and /v/ belief/believe, proof/prove, shelf/shelve
/θ/ and/ð/ cloth/clothe, teeth/teethe
Exceptions:
/s/ only: practice (noun)/practise (verb)
licence (noun)/license (verb)
And note words like ‘associate’, ‘graduate’ and ‘estimate’ where the pronunciation of the noun
is different from that of the verb :
I’m not a university graduate |ˈgrædʒʊət| yet.
I hope to graduate |ˈgrædjʊeɪt| next summer.
2.3.3 Nouns and verbs with the same spelling and pronunciation
Examples: answer change dream end hope offer trouble [> App 3.2]
44
English Grammar
Compound nouns
2.4 Compound nouns
Many nouns in English are formed from two parts (classroom) or, less commonly, three or
more (son-in-law, stick-in-the-mud).
Sometimes compounds are spelt with a hyphen, sometimes not [>2.11].
They are usually pronounced with the stress on the first syllable, but there are exceptions
noted below.
2.5 Single-word compound nouns
There are many words which we no longer think of as compounds at all, even though they
are clearly made up of two words.
Examples: a cupboard / a raincoat / a saucepan / the seaside / a typewriter.
2.6 Nouns formed with adjective + noun
Examples: a greenhouse / a heavyweight / longhand / a redhead
Note the difference in meaning when these words are rearranged as ‘adjective’ + ‘noun’:
heavy weight ≠ heavyweight
2.7 Nouns formed with gerund + noun
Examples: drinking water / a frying pan / a walking stick [>2.11n3]
The meaning is ‘something which is used for doing something’:
Examples: a frying pan (hyphen optional, = a pan that is used for frying)
Compare other ‘-ing’+noun combinations which are not compound nouns and where the ‘-ing’
form is a participle used as an adjective. These combinations are not ‘fixed’, are not spelt with a
hyphen, and are stressed in both parts:
Examples: ‘boiling ‘water (=water that is boiling)
[>6.2, 6.3.1, 6.14, 16.38, 16.39.3]
2.8 Nouns formed with noun + gerund
Examples: horse-riding / sight-seeing / sunbathing [>2.11n3]
Here the meaning is ‘the action of’:
Examples: horse-riding (= the action of riding a horse)
45
English Grammar
2.9 Nouns formed with adverb particles
These compound nouns are combinations of verbs and adverb particles:
Examples: breakdown / income / make up [>Apps 31.35]
2.10 Nouns formed with noun + noun
When two nouns are used together to form a compound noun, the first noun (noun
modifier) usually functions like an adjective and is nearly always in the singular.
This is the largest category of compound nouns and it can be considered under several
headings:
2.10.1 Compound nouns in place of phrases with ‘of’:
Examples: a car key / a chair leg / a door knob / a typewriter key.
When we want to say that one (non-living) thing is part of another, we can use ‘of’, like ‘the
key of the car’ [>2.47].
However, this can sound rather emphatic so we often use a compound noun instead for
things which are closely associated. (such as: a car key)
2.10.2 Compound nouns which refer to place
The first word refers to a place and the second word refers to something that is in that place.
Both words are closely associated and are stressed but not hyphenated.
Examples: the ‘bank ‘safe / a ‘personal com’puter / a ‘kitchen ‘sink
Also note place names: ‘London ‘Airport, ‘Moscow ‘Stadium, etc.
2.10.3 Compound nouns which refer to streets and roads
Where the word ‘street’ occurs, the stress is on the first syllable:
Baker Street / Oxford Street
Where the word ‘road’ occurs, both parts are stressed:
‘Canterbury ‘Road / the ‘Oxford ‘road
Compound place names are not hyphenated.
2.10.4 Compound nouns which tells us about purpose [compare>2.7]
a bookcase / a can opener / a meeting point / a sheep dog
The second word suggests a use relating to the first:(􁶲􀬧􀸎􀞈􀝍􀔧􀒘)(hyphen normally
optional), A can opener is ‘a device for opening cans’.
2.10.5 Compound nouns which tell us about materials and substances
a ‘cotton ‘blouse / a ‘gold ‘watch / a ‘plastic ‘raincoat
46
English Grammar
The first word refers to a substance or material, the second to something made of that
substance or material[>6.13].
2.10.6 Compound nouns which ‘classify types’
a horror film / a headlamp / a seat belt
The first word answers the question ‘What kind of …?’. These combinations can be extended
to people and the things they do, as in:
a bookseller / a factory worker / a taxi driver
Note the difference between an ‘English teacher (one who teaches English) and an English
‘teacher (one who is English).
Other compounds refer to pieces of apparatus and what operates them, as in:
a gas boiler / a pressure cooker / a vacuum cleaner
Note the many combinations with ‘shop’: ‘a flower shop’, ‘a shoe shop’, etc. For combinations
like ‘butchers (shop)’ [>2.51.3, 20.4]
2.10.7 Compound nouns which refer to ‘containers’
a biscuit tin / a coffee cup / a teapot / a sugar bowl
The second item is designed to contain the first [>2.18.2]
2.10.8 Compound nouns which relate to time
A number of combinations relate specifically to the time at which an activity takes place or
to its duration.
‘afternoon ‘tea / ‘morning ‘coffee / the ‘Sunday ‘lunch / a ‘two-hour ‘walk
Also note other nouns relating to time:
an ‘evening ‘dress / a ‘night ‘nurse
2.10.9 Compound nouns formed with ‘self’, ‘man’, ‘woman’ and ‘person’
Self- (stress on some part of the second word)
self-‘consciousness / self-con’trol / self den’ial / self-res’pect
man/woman (stress on first word)
an airman / a fireman / a gentleman/woman / a man-eater / a man hour
Some people replace ‘man’ by ‘person’ in a few nouns when the reference is to either sex:
a chairperson / a salesperson [>2.40.4]
2.10.10 Proper nouns with two or more parts
a ‘Ford ‘car / an ‘IBM com’puter / ‘Longman ‘Books / ‘Shell ‘Oil / a ‘North Sea ‘oil rig / a/the
‘Tate ‘Gallery Exhi’bition.
2.11 A note on hyphens
47
English Grammar
There are no precise rules, so the following are brief guidelines:
1. When two short nouns are joined together, they form one word without out a hyphen (a
teacup). We do not join two short nouns if this leads to problems of recognition. (bus stop,
Not*busstop*)
2. Hyphens are often used for ‘verb + particle’ combinations (make-up)[>App31.35] and
‘self-’ combinations (self-respect).
3. When a compound is accepted as a single word, the tendency is to write it as one word
(sunbathing). In other cases, the use of the hyphen is at the discretion of the writer, but the
tendency is to avoid hyphens where possible.
48
English Grammar
Countable and uncountable nouns
2.12 Types of nouns
• proper noun
• common noun
• countable (concrete/abstract)
• uncountable (concrete/abstract)
2.13.1 Proper nouns
A proper noun (sometimes called a ‘proper name’) is used for a particular person, place,
thing or idea which is, or is imagined to be unique. It is generally spelt with a capital letter.
Articles are not normally used in front of proper nouns, but [>3.9.4, 3.31].
Proper nouns include for example:
• Personal names (with or without titles)
• Forms of address
• Geographical names
• Place names
• Months, days of the week, festivals and seasons [>Apps 24.48] (Seasons are usually spelt
with a small letter, but sometimes with a capital : spring or Spring)
• For other names [>3.22, 3.27, 3.31]
2.13.2 Common nouns
Any noun that is not the name of a particular person, place, thing or idea is a common noun.
We can use ‘a/an’, ‘the’ or ‘the zero article’ in front of common nouns [>Chapter 3].
*2.14 How to identify countable and uncountable nouns
All common nouns fall into one of two sub-classes, they may be either countable nouns
(sometimes known as unit or count nouns) or uncountable nouns (sometimes known as
mass or non-count nouns).
The distinction between countable and uncountable nouns is fundamental in English, for
only by distinguishing between the two can we understand when to use singular or plural
forms and when to use the indefinite, definite and zero articles (a/an, the and ∅)[>3.2-3] or the
appropriate quantifier ‘a few,’ ‘many’, ‘much’, etc.[>3.1, 5.1]
Unfortunately, we cannot always rely on common sense (using the idea of counting as a
guide) to tell us when a noun is countable or uncountable.
49
English Grammar
For example, the noun ‘information’ is uncountable in English, but its equivalent in another
language may refer to an item or items of information and will therefore be countable[>2.17].
‘Experience’ is uncountable, but we can refer to ‘an experience’ to mean an event which
contributes to experience.
They want someone with experience for this job.
I had a strange experience the other day.
Many nouns which are normally uncountable can be used as countable in certain contexts
[>2.16.3]. This suggests that strict classifications of nouns as countable or uncountable are in
many case unreliable. It would be better to think in terms of countable and uncountable uses of
nouns. For detailed information about individual nouns, consult a good dictionary.
2.14.1 Countable nouns
If a noun is countable:
• we can use ‘a/an’ in front of it:
a book / an envelope
• it has a plural and can be used in the question ‘How many?’:
How many stamps/envelopes? - Four stamps/envelopes.
• we can use numbers:
one stamp / two stamps
2.14.2 Uncountable nouns
If a noun is uncountable:
• we do not normally use a/an in front of it.
• it does not normally have a plural and it can be used in the question ‘How much?’:
How much meat/oil? - A lot of meat./ A little oil.
• we cannot normally use a number in front of it.
2.15 Concrete and abstract nouns
Many countable nouns are concrete (having an individual physical existence), for
example:
• persons, animals, plants
• objects
• groups
• units of measurement
• parts of a mass
Concrete uncountable nouns (sometimes having physical but not ‘individual’ existence)
include words like:
• Materials, liquids, gases
• ‘Grains’ and ‘powder’
50
English Grammar
• Activities
• Languages
A few countable nouns are abstract:
a hope / an idea / a nuisance / a remark / a situation
A number of abstract nouns can be used only as countable :
A denial / a proposal / a scheme / a statement
Many uncountable nouns are abstract:
anger / equality / honesty
2.16 Nouns which can be either countable or uncountable
Some nouns may be countable or uncountable depending on their use.
2.16.1 Nouns we can think of as ‘single items’ or ‘substances’
a chicken/chicken, an egg/egg, a ribbon/ribbon
When we use these as countable, we refer to them as single items; when we use them as
uncountable, we refer to them as substances:
countable (a single item) uncountable (substance/material)
He ate a whole chicken! Would you like some chicken?
I had a boiled egg for breakfast. There’s egg on your face.
I tied it up with a ribbon. I bought a meter of ribbon.
2.16.2 Nouns which refer to objects or material
a glass/glass, an ice/ice, an iron/iron, a paper/paper
When we use such nouns as countable, we refer to a thing which is made of the material or
which we think of as being made of the material; when we use them as uncountable, we refer
only to the material.
Countable uncountable
I broke a glass this morning. Glass is made from sand.
Would you like an ice? Ice floats.
I’ve got a new iron. Steel is an alloy of iron.
What do the papers say? Paper is made from wood.
2.16.3 Normally uncountable nouns used as countable nouns
Many nouns which are normally uncountable can be used as countables if we refer to
particular varieties. When this occurs, the noun is often preceded by an adjective (a nice wine)
or there is some kind of specification (a wine of high quality):
This region produces an excellent wine. (a kind of wine which…)
Kalamata produces some of the best olive oil in the world, it’s an oil of very high quality. (a kind of oil
which…)
The North Sea produces a light oil which is highly prized in the oil industry.
Normally uncountable nouns used exceptionally as countables can also occur in the plural:
51
English Grammar
This region produces some awful wines as well as good ones.
I go out in all weathers.
Note also many words for drinks, which are uncountable when we think of them as
substances:
Beer/coffee/tea is expensive these days.
However, we can sometimes use ‘a/an’ to mean: a glass of, etc.[>2.18] or numbers in front of
these words, or we can make them plural, for example when we are ordering in a restaurant:
A (or One) beer please.
Two teas and four coffees, please.
2.16.4 Nouns which can refer to something specific or general
an education/education, a light/light, a noise/noise
As countables, these nouns refer to something specific (He has had a good education. I need a
light by my bed.).
As uncountables, the reference is general (Standards of education are falling. Light travels
faster than sound).
Some countable nouns like this can be plural (a light/lights, a noise/noises). Other nouns
(education, knowledge) cannot be plural; as countables they often have some kind of
qualification (a classical education, a good knowledge of English).
2.16.5 Nouns ending in ‘-ing’
a drawing/drawing, a painting/painting, a reading/reading
‘-ing’ forms are generally uncountable [>16.39.1], but a few can refer to a specific thing or
event.
Countable (‘specific’) Uncountable (‘general’)
Are these drawings by Goya? I’m no good at drawing.
He has a painting by Hockney. Painting is my hobby.
She gave a reading of her poems. Reading is taught early.
A few ‘-ing’ forms (a thrashing, a wedding) are only countable.
2.16.6 Selected uncountable nouns and their countable equivalents
Some uncountables cannot be used as countables to refer to a single item or example. A
quite different word must be used:
uncountable equivalent countable
bread a loaf
clothing a garment
laughter a laugh
luggage a case, a bag
poetry a poem
money a coin, a note
work [but>2.31,2.33] a job
52
English Grammar
Nouns for animals are countable; nouns for meat are uncountable:
a cow/beef, a deer/venison, a pig/pork, a sheep/mutton
2.17 Nouns not normally countable in English
A number of nouns which are countable in other languages (and are therefore used in the
singular and plural in those languages) are usually uncountable in English (and therefore not
normally used with a/an or in the plural). A few common examples are:
baggage, furniture, information, macaroni, machinery, spaghetti [>App 4]
We bought (some) new furniture for our living room recently.
I’d like some information please.
2.18 Partitives: nouns which refer to part of a whole
We can refer to a single item (a loaf of bread), a part of a whole (a slice of bread) or a collection of
items (a packet of biscuits) by means of partitives. Partitives are useful when we want to refer to
specific pieces of an uncountable substance, or to a limited number of countable items. They
can be singular (a piece of paper; a box of matches) or plural (two pieces of paper; two boxes of matches) and are
followed by ‘of’ when used before a noun.
The most useful are:
2.18.1 General partitives
Words such as piece and (less formal) bit can be used with a large number of uncountables.
a piece of / pieces of / a bit of / bits of
2.18.2 Specific partitives
Here is a brief summary, but [>App 5] for more examples.
• Single items or amounts:
a ball of string / a bar of chocolate / a cube of ice / a sheet of paper / a lump of sugar
a few of these can be re-expressed as compounds:
a sugar lump / ice cubes
• ‘Containers’ used as partitives: [>2.10.7]
a bag of flour / a box of matches / a cup of coffee / a jar of jam / a pot of tea / a tube of toothpaste
Most of these can be re-expressed as compounds to describe the container itself:
a jam-jar / a matchbox / a teapot
• Small quantities: a drop of water, a pinch of salt
• Measures: a kilo of sugar, a meter of cloth
• ‘a game of’: a game of football
• Abstract concepts: a period of calm, a spell of work
• Types and species: a make of car[􀓞􁐿􀿻􁫣􁇈􀧼], a sort of cake
53
English Grammar
• ‘a pair of’: a pair of gloves, a pair of jeans [>App 5.8]
2.19 Collective nouns[集合名词] followed by ‘of’
These describe groups (or ‘collections’) of people or things:
• People: an army of soldiers / a board of directors
• Animals, birds, insects: a flock of birds / sheep, a swarm of bees
• Plants and fruit: a bunch of flowers, a crop of apples
• Things: a set of cutlery, a suit of clothes
For more examples [>App 6]. For other collective nouns [2.28].

Chapter3 Articles
General information about ‘a/an’ ‘the’ and
the zero article
3.1 Determiners: what they are and what they do
We use a number of words n front of common nouns (or adjective + common noun) which
we call determiners because they affect (or ‘determine’) the meaning of the noun.
Determiners make it clear, for example, which particular thing(s) we are referring to or how
much of a substance we are talking about. Singular countable nouns must normally have a
determiners in front of them. There are two classes:
1. Words which help us to classify or identify:
- indefinite article: I bought a new shirt yesterday.
- definite article: The shirt I am wearing is new.
- demonstratives[>4.32]: I bought this/that shirt yesterday.
- possessives[4.19]: Do you like my new shirt?
2. Words which enable us to indicate quantity:
- numbers[>App 47]: I bought two new shirts yesterday.
- quantifiers[>5.1]: I didn’t buy many new shirts yesterday.
There wasn’t much material in the shop.
Proper nouns [>2.13] do not generally require identification, but for place names, etc. place
see [>3.22, 3.31].
John is flying to Helsinki on Tuesday.
3.2 Indefinite (a/an), definite(the), or zero(∅)?
In most European languages there are rules about when to use (or not use) indefinite and
definite articles. These rules generally depend on the gender of the noun and on whether it is
singular or plural. In English, gender does not affect our choice [> 2.39], but whether a word is
singular or plural may do so.
58
English Grammar
We often use no article at all in English. This non-use of the article is so important that we
give it a name, the zero article [>3.24]. The problem of choice can be summarised as follows:
3.3 in front of countables and uncountables
The distinction between countable and uncountable nouns must be clearly understood
because it affects our choice of article.
• singular countable: a/an or the
• plural countable: the or zero
• uncountable: zero
These are general principles, and can be broken in some case.
3.4 Word order and determiners
We usually put only one determiner in front of a noun or noun phrase; and the determiner is
nearly always the first word in a noun phrase, such as: a new pen.
We can never use two of the following before a noun:
a, the, this, that, these, those, my, your, his, her, Susan’s, etc.
Some words (called pre-determiners) can come before articles and other determiners: for
example both and all [>5.18].
The indefinite article: a/an
3.5 a/an, zero article and ‘some’
• a/an and zero for classification / identification[>3.9]
It’s a book. / they’re books.
It’s an egg. / they’re eggs.
• a/an and some referring to quantity[>3.10]
I’ve got a book. / I’ve got some books.
I’ve got an egg. / I’ve got some eggs.
3.6 ‘a/an’ vs ‘some/any’
In the plural, when the exact number is not important, we can use quantifiers like some, a
few, a lot of [>5.2], Some / any [>5.10] are the commonest of these and can be said to be the
plural of a/an when we are referring to unspecified number:
59
English Grammar
3.7 The pronunciation of ‘a’ and ‘an’
a: used before consonant sounds
an: used before vowel sounds
For example, if you want use ‘a/an’ before letters, then:
(This is) a B, C, D, G, J, K, P, Q, T, U, V, W, Y, Z.
(This is) an A, E, F, H, I, L, M, N, O, R, S, X.
Compare: a fire but an F , a noise but an N, an umbrella but a uniform, etc.
A few words beginning with ‘h’ may be preceded by ‘a’ or ‘an’ at the discretion of the
speaker:
a hotel/ an hotel, a historian/ an historian
If such words are used with ‘an’, then ‘h’ is not pronounced or is pronounced softly.
Some common abbreviations are preceded by ‘a’ or by ‘an’ depending on their first
letter:
an I.Q. (Intelligence Quotient)
The pronunciation /ei/ instead of /ə/ for ‘a’ is often used when we are speaking with special
emphasis, with or without a pause:
He still refers to his record-player as 'a /ei/ gramophone’.
Many native speakers disapprove of the strong pronunciation of a, commonly heard in the
language of e.g. broadcasters, because it sounds unnatural.
3.8 Basic uses of ‘a/an’
When using a/an, we must always bear in mind two basic facts:
1. A/an has an indefinite meaning
2. A/an can combine only with a singular countable noun.
These two facts underlie all uses of a/an. Some of the most important of these uses are
discussed in the sections that follow.
3.9 Classification: ‘a/an’ to mean ‘an example of that class’
60
English Grammar
NTOE: Many uncountable nouns also can be used after ‘a/an’ when we are referring to 'an
example of that class' [> 2.16.3]:
This is a very good coffee. Is it Brazilian?
3.9.3 Classification by means of descriptive labels [compare>3.19.1]
We often wish to classify people in terms of the work they do, where they come from, etc. In
English (unlike many other European languages) we need to use a/an when we are, as it were,
attaching labels to people with regard to:
Origins: He’s a Frenchman/ an American.[>App 49]
Occupation: She’s a doctor. /He’s an electrician.
Religion: She’s a Catholic. / He’s an Anglican.
Politics: He’s a Socialist / a Republican.
The plurals would be: They’re Frenchmen/doctors, etc.
Adjectival equivalents (where they exist) can be used in place of nouns for all the above
examples except occupation:
He’s European/French/Catholic/Socialist.
But: What does he do? -He’s a taxi-driver.
We need ‘a/an’ with any kind of ‘labelling’:
- with nouns: You’re an angel/a saint/a wonder.
- with adjective + noun: You’re a good girl/ a real angel.
Things, animals, etc. can also be classified with a/an:
Objects: It’s a (kind of/sort of/type of) bottle-opener.
Insects: It’s a (kind of/sort of/type of) beetle.
Plants: It’s a (kind of/sort of/type of) rose.
A kind of, etc. is more specific when used with reference to things, etc. than when it is
used for people:
I’m a kind of (/sort of/type of) engineer. (=That’s the nearest I can come to describing my
job.)
It’s a kind of (/sort of/type of) beetle. (=It’s a member of a particular class of beetle)
3.9.4 The use of ‘a/an’ to classify people, etc.[>2.13.1]
A/an can be used freely to refer to ‘an example of that class’. We can use He’s/It’s a + name
for ‘tangible examples’:
It’s a Picasso; It’s a Dickens novel; He’s a Forsyte.
[compare > 3.27.4]
61
English Grammar
3.9.5 The use of ‘a/an’ to refer to ‘a certain person’
A/an can be used before titles (Mr, Mrs, Miss, etc.) with the sense of ‘a certain person whom
I don’t know’:
A Mr Wingate phoned and left a message for you.
A Mrs Tadley is waiting to see you.
The phrase a certain, to refer to people whose identity is not yet know, is common in fables
and folk stories:
Many years ago a certain merchant arrived in Baghdad.
3.10 Quantity: the use of ‘a/an’ to mean ‘only one’
The most common use of a/an is in the sense of ‘only one’ when we are not specifying any
particular person or thing:
I’d like an apple.(only one, it doesn’t matter which)
When we express this in the plural, we use some or any [>5.10]:
I’d like some apples. / I don’t want any apples.[compare> 3.28.8]
For a/an +uncountable to refer to ‘only one’[>2.16.3, 3.9.2].
3.10.2 The use of ‘a/an’ when something is mentioned for the first time
A/an is used before a countable noun mentioned for the first time: the speaker assumes the
listener does not know what is referred to:
I looked up and saw a plane (Mentioned for the first time - you don’t know which plane I mean.) The
plane flew low over the trees (You now know exactly which plane I mean and the plane is, in that sense,
identified). [>3.20.1]
This rule governing the choice between definite and indefinite article is common in
European languages.
3.11 The difference between ‘a/an’ and ‘one’
One and a/an cannot normally be used interchangeably.
We use one when we are counting (one apple, as opposed to two or three):
It was one coffee we ordered, not two.
But we could not use ‘one’ to mean ‘any one’ (not specified):
A knife is no good. You need a screwdriver to do the job properly.
One is often used with day, morning, etc. in story-telling:
One day, many years later, I found out what had really happened.
62
English Grammar
A/an and one can be used interchangeably when we refer to:
• Whole numbers: a (or one) hundred, thousand, million [>App 47]
• Fractions: a (or one) quarter, third, half, etc.
• Money: a (or one) pound/dollar. etc. (But: we need say ‘One pound 50’)
• Weight/measure: a (or one) pound/kilo, foot/metre, etc.
A/an and one are interchangeable in some expressions (with a/one blow), but not in others
(a few). For ‘one’ as a pronoun[>4.9-11].
3.12 The use of ‘a/an’ with reference to measurement
A/an is used when we refer to one unit of measurement in terms of another. If we want to
emphasise ‘each’, we use ‘per’ instead of ‘a/an’:
• Price in relation to weight: 80p a/per kilo
• Distance in relation to speed: 40 km an/per hour
• Distance/fuel consumption: 30 miles a/per gallon
• Frequency/time: twice a/per day
3.13 The use of ‘a/an’ after ‘what’ and ‘such’
A/an is used with countable nouns after ‘What’ in exclamations:
What a surprise! What an interesting story!
A/an is used after such when we wish to emphasise degree [>7.51.1]:
That child is such a pest! My boss is such an idiot!
What a lot (Not *How much/many…!*) is used for exclamations:
What a lot of flowers! What a lot of trouble!
3.14 The use of ‘a/an’ with pairs of nouns
Many nouns are ‘paired’, that is they are considered to accompany each other naturally,
and a/an is used before the first noun of a pair:
a cup and saucer, a hat and coat, a knife and fork.
It’s cold outside. Take a hat and coat with you.
If two words are used which are not considered to be a ‘natural pair’, the indefinite
article must be used before each noun:
When you go on holiday, take a raincoat and a camera.
3.15 The use of ‘a/an’,etc. with reference to illnesses/conditions
63
English Grammar
The use of the indefinite and zero articles with illnesses can be defined in four categories:
1. Expressions where the use of the indefinite article is compulsory:
a cold / a headache / a sore throat / a weak heart / a broken leg
I’ve got a headache / a cold.
2. Expressions where the use of the indefinite article is optional:
catch (a) cold, have (a) backache/stomach-ache/toothache, (an) earache
I’ve had (a) toothache all night.
3. With illnesses which are plural in form, no article is used [compare>2.31]:
measles, mumps, shingles, etc.
My children are in bed with mumps.
4. With illnesses which are defined as ‘uncountable’, no article is used:
flu, gout, hepatitis, etc.
I was in bed with flu for ten days.
‘The’ will also combine with: flu, measles and mumps, etc.
He’s got the flu/the measles/the mumps.
上述⼏条之间是否存在⽭盾？
The definite article: ‘the’
3.16 Form of ‘the’
The never varies in form whether it refers to people or things, singular or plural.
3.17 The pronunciation of ‘the’
• The is pronounced /ðə/ before consonant sounds.
• The is pronounced /ði/ before vowel sounds.
• When we wish to draw attention to the noun that follows, we use the pronunciation /ði/
=“the one and only” or “the main one”:
Do you mean the Richard Burton, the actor?
If you get into difficulties, Monica is the person to ask.
• Some common abbreviations are preceded by ‘the’, pronounced:
/ðə/the BBC
/ði/ the EEC
About abbreviations: we tend to use full stops with titles, but not with institutions, etc.
3.18 Basic uses of ‘the’
64
English Grammar
When using ‘the’, we must always bear in mind two basic facts:
1. The normally has a definite reference (the person or thing referred to is assumed to be
known to the speaker or reader.)
2. The can combine with singular countable, plural countable and uncountable nouns
(which are always singular).
The two facts underline all uses of ‘the’.
Some of the most important of these uses are discussed in the sections that follow.
3.19 ‘the’ for classifying
3.19.1 three ways of making general statements: ‘the’, zero, ‘a/an’.
1. the + singular:
2. zero + plural:
3. a/an + singular:
*3.19.2 ‘The’ + nationality adjective: the group as a whole [>App 49]
• Some nationality adjectives, particular those ending in -ch, -sh and -ese are used after
the when we wish to refer to ‘the group as a whole’:
the British = the British people in general
However, we cannot say *many British* or *those two British*, etc.
• Plural nationality nouns can be used with the or the zero article to refer to the group
as a whole:
the Americans or Americans
or with numbers or quantifiers like some and many to refer to individuals:
two Americans , some Americans
Example:
The British and the Americans have been allies for a long time.
The Japanese admire the traditions of the Chinese.
For the use of the + adjective {the young, the old, etc.} [>6.12.2]
3.19.3 ‘The’ + plural names: the group as a whole [compare>3.22]
• The + plural name can refer to ‘the group as a whole’:
• Families: the Price sisters (􀸦􁞯􀷚􀦥􀦟)
• ‘Races’: the Europeans (􀽾􁁖􀕈)
• Politics: the Liberals (􁛔􁊧􀘾)
• Titles beginning with ‘the’ given to particular groups to emphasise their identity:
the Beatles / the Jesuits
65
English Grammar
3.19.4 Specified groups: ‘the’ + collective noun or plural countable
• the police / the public [>2.28.2, 2.29]
This new increase in fares won’t please the public.
• the bosses / the unions [>2.28.1]
Getting the unions and the bosses to agree isn’t easy.
3.20 ‘the’ for specifying
‘The’ shows that the noun has been specified by the context/situation or grammatically.
3.20.1 back-reference
Something that has been mentioned is referred to again.
3.20.2 the + noun +of
the freedom of the individual / the life of Napoleon
3.20.3 clauses and phrases
the … + clause / the … + phrase:
the Smith you are looking for / the letters in the shelf
3.20.4 limited context
The can be used in contexts which are limited enough for the listener or reader to identify
who or what is referred to.
• people:
Who’s at the door? - It’s the postman.
• places: [>Apps 21-23]
Where’s Jenny? - She’s gone to the butcher’s.
- She’s at the supermarket/ in the garden.
